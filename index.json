These data, represented as timestamped action sequences, keep track of respondents’ response processes of solving the items. Process data analysis aims at enhancing educational as- sessment accuracy and serving other assessment purposes by utilizing the rich information contained in response processes. The R package ProcData presented in this article is de- signed to provide tools for processing, describing, and analyzing process data. We define an S3 class ‘proc’ for organizing process data and extend generic methods summary and print for ‘proc’. Two feature extraction methods for process data are implemented in the package for compressing information in the irregular response processes into regular nu- meric vectors. ProcData also provides functions for fitting and making predictions from a neural-network-based sequence model. These functions call relevant functions in package keras for constructing and training neural networks. In addition, several response process generators and a real dataset of response processes of the climate control item in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment are included in the package.","tags":[],"title":"ProcData: An R package for process data analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhi Wang","Xueying Tang","Jingchen Liu"],"categories":["theory"],"content":"","date":1592697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592697600,"objectID":"aa3f8d61df3935c7015d18295483e40c","permalink":"https://zhiwpku.github.io/publication/mrn_theory/","publishdate":"2020-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mrn_theory/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Statistical analysis of multi-relational network recovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xueying Tang","Zhi Wang","Jingchen Liu","Zhiliang Ying"],"categories":["stat.ML","stat.AP"],"content":"","date":1590105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590105600,"objectID":"97f1210237af7cc1eb9cf77690fb03d5","permalink":"https://zhiwpku.github.io/publication/process_data_seq2seq/","publishdate":"2020-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/process_data_seq2seq/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer simulations have become a popular tool for assessing complex skills such as problem‐solving. Log files of computer‐based items record the human–computer interactive processes for each respondent in full. The response processes are very diverse, noisy, and of non‐standard formats. Few generic methods have been developed to exploit the information contained in process data. In this paper we propose a method to extract latent variables from process data. The method utilizes a sequence‐to‐sequence autoencoder to compress response processes into standard numerical vectors. It does not require prior knowledge of the specific items and human–computer interaction patterns. The proposed method is applied to both simulated and real process data to demonstrate that the resulting latent variables extract useful information from the response processes.","tags":["autoencoder","feature extraction","recurrent neural network"],"title":"An exploratory analysis of the latent structure of process data via action sequence autoencoders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xueying Tang","Zhi Wang","Qiwei He","Jingchen Liu","Zhiliang Ying"],"categories":["stat.AP"],"content":"","date":1589760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589760000,"objectID":"7ce4b05169264bbcd234daa7e4ddaecf","permalink":"https://zhiwpku.github.io/publication/process_data_mds/","publishdate":"2020-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/process_data_mds/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer-based interactive items have become prevalent in recent educational assessments. In such items, detailed human-computer interactive process, known as response process, is recorded in a log file. The recorded response processes provide great opportunities to understand individuals’ problem solving processes. However, difficulties exist in analyzing these data as they are high dimensional sequences in a nonstandard format. This paper aims at extracting useful information from response processes. In particular, we consider an exploratory analysis that extracts latent variables from process data through a multidimensional scaling framework. A dissimilarity measure is described to quantify the discrepancy between two response processes. The proposed method is applied to both simulated data and real process data from 14 PSTRE items in PIAAC 2012. A prediction procedure is used to examine the information contained in the extracted latent variables. We find that the extracted latent variables preserve a substantial amount of information in the process and have reasonable interpretability. We also empirically prove that process data contains more information than classic binary item responses in terms of out-of-sample prediction of many variables.","tags":["response process","log file analysis","multidimentional scaling"],"title":"Latent feature extraction for process data via multidimensional scaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph B.
